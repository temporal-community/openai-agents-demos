[ACTION: Worker killed, retrying in orange]

When I bring a worker back online, I can see the agent picks up exactly where it left off.

No work was lost.

And if I run many workers, I can handle millions of agents running in parallel.

Steve: So stop building agents that fall over and don’t scale. Start building durable AI agents today with Temporal and the OpenAI Agents SDK.
